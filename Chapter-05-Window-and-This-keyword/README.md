# Chapter - 04 | windoe and this keyword

- when we run empty javascript file  an global execution context is created

- js also creates the window

- window -> an big object with lot of functions, variables and objects
- these objects functions and variables created by js engine in global scope

- along withn the window object is also creates the this keyword at global level

- this keyword points to window object

- all js engine have responsibility to create this global object

- this === window - returns true

-  In JavaScript, variables declared using the var keyword inside a function are function-scoped. This means they are only accessible within the function in which they are declared, and not outside of it.

- On the other hand, variables declared using var at the global scope (outside any function) are accessible from anywhere in the program, including within functions. This is because global variables have a scope that spans the entire program.
