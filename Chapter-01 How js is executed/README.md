# Chapter - 01 - How Js Code is Executed

### "Everything in JavaScript happens inside the execution context."
- Execution context is a big container where javascript code is executed
-  (Chapter-01)[file:///C:/Users/Chaitra/Downloads/Chapter-01.pdf]

## Execution context consists of two components
   1. Memory Component
       - also called a variable component
       - variable declaration and whole functions are stored in memory components in key-value pairs
   2. Code component
       - entire js code is executed line by line


## javascript characteristics
  - Javascript is a synchronous single-threaded language
  - synchronous: it executes one command at a time in a specific order
  - single-threaded: executes on;y one line at a time once the line is executed successfully it goes to the next line
